## History
#### 01 Nov 2016: 

* Created repository
* Uploaded original and combined data sets.

#### 06 Nov 2016:

* Uploaded HRR charges file (summary of IP charges by hospital referral region).

#### 07 Nov 2016:

* Updated DRG descriptions for DRG 065 for:
    - 2013 IP Charge data set
    - 2014 IP Charge data set
    - HRR Summary IP Charge data set  
    
&nbsp;&nbsp;The DRG descriptions were inconsistent across years (2011-2012 had one description, and 2013-2014 had a different description).  In the updated data sets, this has been fixed to make all descriptions for DRG 065 consistent: "065 - INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE OR CEREBRAL INFARCTION W CC."

#### 05 Dec 2016:

* Created master analysis data sets
    - W271_Lab3_Dataset_By_Hosp  (hospital-level rollup of data)
    - W271_Lab3_Dataset_By_Hosp_DRG (at by-hospital-by-DRG level of the original data)

#### 08 Dec 2016:

* Updated statistics for data sets to reflect data used for final modeling.
